== Subby App

This is my starting point for bootstrapping a web-app that includes:

- Chargify for billing and subscriptions
- Subdomain-based accounts (that also allow custom domain mapping)
- User authentication (via AuthLogic)

== Requirements

Subby is using Rails 3 (beta 4). It also requires the Rails 3 branch of a forked version of the AuthLogic gem and a forked version of the Chargify gem. 

== Known Issues

With AuthLogic, the authenticates_many method is currently brokenâ€“preventing you from easily scoping user sessions to a subdomain. So far, this has been patched by updating the require_user method in the application controller. 

Some rspec tests are still failing ... mainly because I'm a n00b at rspec.
